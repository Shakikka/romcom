* If there is a cover in your `Saved Covers` display that you dislike, you can double click them to delete them!

* Be sure to have a great time with these covers!


### Future Additions

* When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger
* Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
* Add a price tag change
